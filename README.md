# Polymer vs Angular 2 for Tampere Polymer Meetup

Link to the presentation: [Polymer vs Angular 2][1].

This is my small presentation for "Polymer vs Angular 2" from a learning point of view. I presented it at Tampere Polymer Meetup. The presentation alone isn't really worth much more than to act as a catalyst for the conversations in the subjects and to get us discussing more about the future of different frameworks and their burndown rates.
